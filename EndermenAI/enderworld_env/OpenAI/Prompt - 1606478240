Sure! While I can't provide the lyrics to "Perfect" by Ed Sheeran, I can help you create original lyrics inspired by its themes. Here’s a set of romantic lyrics for you:

---

**Verse 1**  
In the soft glow of the evening light,  
With your hand in mine, everything feels right.  
Every moment, we dance so close,  
In this world, it’s you I love the most.

**Chorus**  
You’re my dream, my heart’s delight,  
In your arms, I feel so alive.  
Through the storms and the quiet nights,  
I’ll hold you close, forever by your side.

**Verse 2**  
Whispers of love in the midnight air,  
Every heartbeat, I know you care.  
With every laugh, every tear we share,  
In this journey, we’ll go anywhere.

**Chorus**  
You’re my dream, my heart’s delight,  
In your arms, I feel so alive.  
Through the storms and the quiet nights,  
I’ll hold you close, forever by your side.

**Bridge**  
And when the stars light up the sky,  
I’ll promise you, I’ll never say goodbye.  
With each sunrise, our love will grow,  
In this perfect moment, I want you to know.

**Chorus**  
You’re my dream, my heart’s delight,  
In your arms, I feel so alive.  
Through the storms and the quiet nights,  
I’ll hold you close, forever by your side.

**Outro**  
So here we stand, just you and me,  
In this perfect love, we’re meant to be.  
With every heartbeat, my heart will sing,  
You’re my forever, my everything.
